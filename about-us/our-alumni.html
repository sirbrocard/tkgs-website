            <h2>Our Alumni</h2>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
              The idea of forming an Alumni was brought about by Mrs Huang Chai Lean, a former principal of TKGS.
            </p>
            <p>In early 1987, she invited a group of former students to form the Pro-temp committee. This committee drafted up the direction for the Alumni and made the necessary preparations for its official formation.</p>
            <p>Hence, the TKGS Alumni was registered on 15 October 1987.
            </p>
            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>to develop and maintain a true spirit of loyalty for the Alma Mater.
              </li>
              <li>to maintain close links with the Alma Mater so as to help her achieve her objectives.
              </li>
              <li>to enable members to renew ties for mutual benefits
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our aspiration for being a school of distinction must start from within, with the girls who come through our portals understand how special it is to be TKGian, to understand the obligations and responsibilities in upholding that tradition of excellence which we have built over 60 years.  With this in mind, the TKGS Truly curriculum was developed to ensure that generations of TKGians to come will appreciate and magnify the history, culture and ethos of TKGS. This is supported by the Alumni and Youth Chapter, which was established in 2013 when the school celebrated its 60th anniversary.

            <h4>TKGS Homecoming</h4>
            <figure class="quote">
              <blockquote>
                Homecoming event was indeed a special one, especially because it was in commemoration with SG50. Indeed, true to the spirit of celebration, many turned up decked in red and had a great time meeting friends both old and new and celebrating everything that is truly TKGS. What was truly special was that this Homecoming had a focus on our pioneers, those who lifted TKGS on their shoulders and gave us the foundation on which we built the school. Pioneers who attended the event include ex-Principal Mrs Huang Chai Lean and Geography teacher Ms Koh Sauk Yee. Alumni members including Mrs Sally Lee and Miss Sharon Kwek, President of the TKGS Alumni took turns to give tributes to their teachers who had made in impact on them. Mrs Rosalind Quek also took time to share with the younger TKGians her advice on how we could keep the school spirit strong. Generations of TKGians owe it to our pioneers for giving us not only a school but also a second home where some of the best memories were made and friendships were forged. The game that was hosted by one of our senior teachers, Mrs Rita Lopez, really triggered our memory using images and anecdotes from the past. It also made us feel that everyone in the room was connected one way or another, in this unique sisterhood, despite differences in age, race and language. All in all, it was a wonderful platform to connect and recollect. It was perhaps most apt to end the event with a nostalgic singing of the school song accompanied by old images of faces and places of TKGS. Indeed, once a TKGian, always a TKGian.
