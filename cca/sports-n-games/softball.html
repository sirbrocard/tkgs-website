            <h2>Softball</h2>
            <p>TKGS introduced Softball as a CCA in the early 1990s. Passionate coaches and support from the school play a key role to the team’s success as the National Champions in the inter-schools tournaments from 2001 to 2009, 2011 and 2014. This would not have been possible without the guidance of our coaches who between them have a combined experience of over 50 years of coaching at school and national levels. </p>
            
            <p>Our softball players are not only physically challenged but also mentally trained. The game is demanding so players need to be at their peak performance physically and mentally. Our Softballers are dedicated players who place emphasis on academic performance and CCA training so that they get all-round development. The players learn and understand the importance of teamwork in a competitive situation through the game. Our girls have graduated with the winners’ mentality and excelled in their chosen fields beyond Softball.

    <p>On Wed 22 March 2017, our B Division softball team was pitted against Methodist Girls’ School (MGS) in the final after a long and eventful season. Unfortunately, the game had to be postponed to Fri 24 Mar 2017 due to bad weather. The score was 0-0 at the top of the 2nd inning when the match was adjourned.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Friday, the game continued from the top of the 2nd inning, with us batting and with one batter down. After a lacklustre rest of the inning, we found ourselves trailing MGS by three runs at the end of the 2nd inning. However, our girls fought hard and managed to score 2 runs in the following 2 innings by making some really nice hits. At the same time, our team also prevented MGS from scoring, thus trailing them 2-3 at the end of the 3rd inning.  
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in the 4th inning, MGS found a second wind and capitalised on a fielding error by us to score one more run to lead with a score of 4-2 at the end of the 4th inning. With all to lose if we fail to score any runs in the 5th and final inning, tension filled the air as our girls realised the enormity of the task at hand. Despite our valiant efforts, we conceded the game when our captain Sofia was controversially called out by the umpire, after making her way from home base to third base on the back of a fine hit down centre field (she was our third batter to be called or struck out in the 5th inning). Staying true to the spirit of sportsmanship, our girls applauded the umpires, congratulated their opponents, and thanked their supporters despite the disappointment of the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we were down at numerous junctures during the game, our girls showed determination and perseverance to fight till the end. The team played a good game and gave MGS a good fight.
    </p>
    <p>  
        This season has been full of ups and downs. The softball team had a new coach and had to adapt to his style of playing softball. The players trained very hard, sometimes on weekends in order to prepare themselves for the season. The sacrifices of the coaches, teachers and players paid off and we are happy to have come this far as this year had been a tough year for all of us.
