            <h2>Literary & Debating Society</h2>
<p>
            The mission of LDS is to nurture every member to be an eloquent speaker and a creative writer. Students are carefully selected through an interview and aptitude test. We welcome students who show the potential for skilful communication and a love for literary arts.
</p>
<p>
            Within LDS, you can choose to join our team of enthusiastic debaters or develop your flair for writing. Debaters take part in various debating competitions. In 2013, The TKGS Debaters brought glory to the school by emerging as champions in the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championship (Division 3). The school was promoted to Division 2, where they met with stiffer competition, but rose to the challenge by qualifying for the quarter-finals in 2014 and the semi-finals in 2015. Debaters also have the opportunity to attend debate camps run by the Debate Association of Singapore.
</p>
<p>     
            LDS writers will also have the chance to attend external programmes such as the Creative Arts Programme, jointly organized by the Gifted Education Department of the Ministry of Education and NUS, and the Junior Broadcasters’ Course which is organized by the Centre of Excellence for English (East Zone). 
</p>
<p>        
            We also send teams to participate in oratorical or writing competitions throughout the year. Other activities that keep us engaged are: going on learning journeys, participating in poetry slams, literary recitals, producing our own publications.
</p>
<p>     
            LDS is a CCA that allows you to discover your literary talent and share it with others. It is an enriching journey as we are guided by our passion for words. The skills you learn in LDS are definitely helpful if you wish to have a career in Law, Journalism, Public Relations, Advertising, among others.
</p>

            The Literary & Debating Society contributed a performance called ‘Poetry Palette” to the school’s Arts Fiesta held from 7 to 11 April 2014. In various groups, members chose their favourite piece of poetry and performed it in creative ways, using vocal diversity and movement. Through their personal and group interpretations, the performers brought poetry alive for  the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some teachers also showcased their creativity in poetry writing and participated in the programme. Mr Christopher Roy, Ms Kala and Mrs Lai Fun Smahon recited poems they wrote, and Mrs Rita Lopez explained why Wilfred Owen’s ‘Anthem for Doomed Youth’ was her choice.

          <p>  In conjunction with Text in the City, a nationwide campaign that promotes local poetry and its appreciation, TKGS organized a workshop for our students at the TKGS Arts Café in October 2014, conducted by Cyril Wong, a local poet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who attended the workshop learnt the basics of crafting a poem and how they could make their poetry relevant to their readers. They had the opportunity to let Cyril Wong give personalised feedback that catered to their writing styles, as well as ask the poet for advice regarding poetry-writing and pose questions regarding his craft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who attended this workshop found that it was beneficial to helping them appreciate poetry and improve their writing. Annette Poh (2E3) who participated in the workshop said, “I really enjoyed this workshop conducted by Cyril Wong as I gained a deeper insight into how poems should be crafted and what sort of techniques we could apply in writing poems. I also realised how powerful poems are, because they allow us to connect to the world around us. This workshop has certainly made me gain more interest in creative writing, especially so regarding poems.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the 2-hour workshop, the students submitted their poems through the ‘Text in the City’ mobile app. These poems are compiled with others submitted by members of the public in the ‘Text in the City’ website, textinthecity.sg.</p>

                       <p> During the Arts Fiesta on 9 April this year, we were privileged to have Ms Kuo Jian Hong share with us her life story as a theatre practitioner.</p>
                       <p>

                        Daughter of the late theatre doyen Kuo Pao Kun and Singapore dance pioneer and arts activist, Goh Lay Kuan, Jian Hong followed her parents’ footsteps in pursuing  the arts as a career.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        She shared her early struggles of studying in Singapore, and in coping with a foreign culture, especially her perseverance  to make herself understood, when she went to pursue her studies in America.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        With candor, she talked about the conflict between choosing to pursue drama and directing, as opposed to pursuing an Economics degree and shouldering the high expectations of her family, who ‘emptied the family piggy-bank’ for her.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Jian Hong eventually returned to Singapore with master’s degrees in stage design and directing.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        
                        Jian Hong noted that the arts is about another way of perceiving the world, of living in the world by being creative. She shared helpfully with the girls her wisdom that life is not about what people give you, but about what you can find for yourself. She also shared a lesson that her father taught her, that it was worthwhile spending time “doing what we do not like so that we could do the things that we like”. The girls in the audience also learnt about the importance of having passion for whatever they wish to pursue.</p>

TKGS was among the 8 schools that qualified for the quarter-finals out of 27 secondary schools participating in Division 2 of the 2014 National Secondary Schools Debating Championship. With 3 consecutive wins in the preliminary rounds, our scores also put us ahead of all Div 2 schools.
</p>
<p>
Although we were eventually beaten in the quarter-finals, we are, nonetheless, immensely proud of our debaters as they were participating in a higher division than last year.
</p>
<p>
Individually, our debaters also made their mark. Priya Lakshmi (Sec 3E6) was named 5th Best Speaker and Nur Afiqah Ashefjah (Sec 4E5) was named 8th Best Speaker in the whole tournament.

<p>
Our debater team created a record in the history of debating in TKGS by entering the semi-final round of the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championship (Div 2).
</p>
<p>
After winning 4 consecutive preliminary rounds, our team were up against the Singapore American School, debating the motion: “This House would limit politicians’ term in office.” Although the battle of wits did not rule in our favour, we knew our debaters had done their best and were immensely proud of them!

With the short time given to plan an elaborate script, the improvisational competition requires our members to think creatively and quickly. Through this, they persevered through the stressful requirements of the competition and worked together to deliver a winning performance. We are proud to receive the Challenge Trophy and will work even harder next year to defend the title.</p>
